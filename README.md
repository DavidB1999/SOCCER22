# SOCCER22
This repository contains all relevant scripts from the research project "Success-Score in Professional Soccer – Is there a sweet spot in the analysis of space and ball control?" by me David Brinkjans and my fellow colleagues. This project was part of my work at the Institute of Exercise Training and Sport Informatics at the German Sport University Cologne. <br>

Data can unfortunately not be made publicly available. Please be aware that the code does not work without the correct data within a folder structure that resembles the one used within these scripts. An adaptation of the code to similar data should be possible with basic Python skills based on my comments. <br>

Success-Scores have been calculated via SOCCER© - a match analysis tool developed by Jürgen Perl. An implementation of the Success-Score via Python or similar programming languages is also possible based on the formula provided in the manuscript. <br>
Data was made available to use in the required format, so this repository will not include any data parsing steps that would parse position data into the SOCCER©-format. The parsing procedures required are available in the repository for the more recent project SOCCER23 (https://github.com/DavidB1999/SOCCER23). Feel free to check that out as well. <br>


This folder contains the following Jupyter Notebooks: <br>






The prefix number indicates the order dependency of the code within it. Running a file prefixed with 02 before all 01 files will most likely cause an error. Files with the same prefix can be run indepently from each other. <br>

For some context on the project check out my first publication on the Success-Score. I learned a lot since then though :D <br>

The publication, the product of this code, will be linked here as soon as it is published:
